## Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### 5. Enhanced Configuration Management

## Document: services/tools/toolService.md

#### Tool Service

#### Overview
The ToolService manages the game mechanics and interactive capabilities of the system through a collection of specialized tools. It acts as a central registry for all gameplay tools, processes commands from AI avatars, and coordinates tool execution with appropriate logging.

#### Functionality
- **Tool Registry**: Maintains a collection of available tools and their emoji triggers
- **Command Processing**: Extracts and processes tool commands from avatar messages
- **Action Logging**: Records all tool usage for history and context
- **Dynamic Creation**: Handles creation of game entities when no specific tool matches

#### Implementation
The ToolService extends BasicService and initializes with a suite of specialized tool classes. Each tool is registered with both a name and, optionally, an emoji trigger that can be used in messages.

```javascript
export class ToolService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'locationService',
      'avatarService',
      'itemService',
      'discordService',
      'databaseService',
      'configService',
      'mapService',
    ]);
    
    // Initialize tool registry
    this.tools = new Map();
    this.toolEmojis = new Map();

    // Register tools
    const toolClasses = {
      summon: SummonTool,
      breed: BreedTool,
      attack: AttackTool,
      defend: DefendTool,
      move: MoveTool,
      remember: RememberTool,
      create: CreationTool,
      xpost: XPostTool,
      item: ItemTool,
      respond: ThinkTool,
    };

    Object.entries(toolClasses).forEach(([name, ToolClass]) => {
      const tool = new ToolClass(this.services);
      this.tools.set(name, tool);
      if (tool.emoji) this.toolEmojis.set(tool.emoji, name);
    });
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `extractToolCommands(text)`
Parses a text message to identify and extract tool commands based on emoji triggers. Returns both the commands and a cleaned version of the text.

```javascript
extractToolCommands(text) {
  if (!text) return { commands: [], cleanText: '', commandLines: [] };

  const lines = text.split('\n');
  const commands = [];
  const commandLines = [];
  const narrativeLines = [];

  for (const line of lines) {
    const trimmedLine = line.trim();
    let isCommand = false;
    for (const [emoji, toolName] of this.toolEmojis.entries()) {
      if (trimmedLine.startsWith(emoji)) {
        const rest = trimmedLine.slice(emoji.length).trim();
        const params = rest ? rest.split(/\s+/) : [];
        commands.push({ command: toolName, emoji, params });
        commandLines.push(line);
        isCommand = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!isCommand) narrativeLines.push(line);
  }

  return { commands, text, commandLines };
}
```

#### `getCommandsDescription(guildId)`
Generates a formatted description of all available commands for a given guild, including syntax and descriptions.

#### `processAction(message, command, params, avatar)`
Executes a tool command with the given parameters and handles success/failure logging. If the command doesn't match a known tool, it uses the CreationTool as a fallback.

#### Available Tools
The service manages multiple specialized tools:
- **SummonTool**: Creates new avatars in the current location
- **BreedTool**: Combines traits of two avatars to create a new one

The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }

- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**

   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure

describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### Memory Service

#### Overview
The MemoryService provides long-term memory capabilities for AI avatars, allowing them to recall past events, interactions, and knowledge. It implements both explicit and implicit memory creation, retrieval, and management.

#### Functionality
- **Memory Storage**: Persists memories in the database with metadata
- **Memory Retrieval**: Fetches relevant memories based on context
- **Explicit Memory Creation**: Allows direct creation of memories
- **Implicit Memory Formation**: Automatically extracts significant details from interactions
- **Memory Relevance**: Ranks and filters memories based on importance and recency

#### Implementation
The MemoryService extends BasicService and uses the database to store memory records. Each memory includes content, metadata, and relevance information to facilitate effective retrieval.

```javascript
export class MemoryService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'databaseService',
      'aiService',
      'avatarService',
    ]);
    
    this.db = this.databaseService.getDatabase();
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `createMemory(avatarId, memory, metadata = {})`
Creates a new memory for an avatar with the provided content and metadata.

#### `getMemories(avatarId, limit = 10, query = {})`
Retrieves recent memories for an avatar, optionally filtered by query criteria.

#### `searchMemories(avatarId, searchText)`
Searches an avatar's memories for specific content or keywords.

#### `generateMemoryFromText(avatarId, text)`
Uses AI to extract and formulate memories from conversation text.

#### `deleteMemory(memoryId)`
Removes a specific memory from an avatar's history.

#### Memory Structure
Each memory includes:
- `avatarId`: The owner of the memory
- `memory`: The actual memory content
- `timestamp`: When the memory was formed
- `importance`: A numerical rating of significance (1-10)
- `tags`: Categorization labels for filtering
- `context`: Associated information (location, participants, etc.)
- `source`: How the memory was formed (explicit, conversation, etc.)

#### Memory Retrieval Logic
Memories are retrieved based on a combination of factors:
- Recency (newer memories prioritized)
- Importance (higher importance memories retained longer)
- Relevance (contextual matching to current situation)
- Explicit tagging (categorization for targeted recall)

#### Dependencies
- DatabaseService: For persistence of memory data
- AIService: For generating and extracting memories
- AvatarService: For avatar context and relationships

#### Document: services/core/databaseService.md

#### Database Service

#### Overview
The DatabaseService provides centralized database connectivity, management, and operations for the entire system. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure only one database connection exists throughout the application lifecycle.

#### Functionality
- **Connection Management**: Establishes and maintains MongoDB connections
- **Mock Database**: Provides a fallback in-memory database for development
- **Index Creation**: Creates and maintains database indexes for performance
- **Reconnection Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for failed connections
- **Development Mode Support**: Special handling for development environments

#### Implementation
The service uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one database connection exists at any time. It provides graceful fallbacks for development environments and handles connection failures with reconnection logic.

```javascript
export class DatabaseService {
  static instance = null;

  constructor(logger) {
    if (DatabaseService.instance) {
      return DatabaseService.instance;
    }

    this.logger = logger;
    this.dbClient = null;
    this.db = null;
    this.connected = false;
    this.reconnectDelay = 5000;
    this.dbName = process.env.MONGO_DB_NAME || 'moonstone';

    DatabaseService.instance = this;
  }

  // Additional methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `connect()`
Establishes a connection to MongoDB using environment variables. If in development mode and connection fails, it falls back to an in-memory mock database.

#### `getDatabase()`
Returns the current database instance. If not connected, schedules a reconnection attempt without blocking.

#### `waitForConnection()`
Provides a promise-based way to wait for database connection with configurable retries and delays.

#### `createIndexes()`
Creates necessary database indexes for collections to ensure query performance.

#### `setupMockDatabase()`
Creates an in-memory mock database for development and testing purposes when a real MongoDB connection isn't available.

#### Database Schema
The service automatically creates and maintains several key collections:

- `messages`: User and avatar messages with indexing on username, timestamp, etc.
- `avatars`: Avatar data with various indexes for quick lookup
- `dungeon_stats`: Character statistics for dungeon gameplay
- `narratives`: Avatar narrative history for memory and personality development
- `memories`: Long-term memory storage for avatars
- `dungeon_log`: Action log for dungeon events and interactions
- `x_auth`: Authentication data for Twitter/X integration
- `social_posts`: Social media posts created by avatars

#### Document: services/core/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)

#### Document: services/core/aiService.md

#### AI Service

#### Overview
The AI Service serves as a facade for underlying AI model providers, enabling the system to switch between different AI services with minimal code changes. It acts as a mediator between the application and external AI providers such as OpenRouter, Google AI, and Ollama.

#### Functionality
- **Provider Selection**: Dynamically selects the appropriate AI service provider based on environment configuration
- **Model Management**: Handles model selection, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery
- **Request Formatting**: Prepares prompts and parameters in the format expected by each provider

#### Implementation
The service uses a factory pattern approach by importing specific provider implementations and exporting the appropriate one based on the `AI_SERVICE` environment variable. If the specified provider is unknown, it defaults to OpenRouterAIService.

```javascript
// Export selection based on environment variable
switch (process.env.AI_SERVICE) {
    case 'google':
        AIService = GoogleAIService;
        break;
    case 'ollama':
        AIService = OllamaService;
        break;
    case 'openrouter':
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
    default:
        console.warn(`Unknown AI_SERVICE: ${process.env.AI_SERVICE}. Defaulting to OpenRouterAIService.`);
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
}
```

#### Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Document: services/chat/conversationManager.md

#### Conversation Manager

#### Overview
The ConversationManager orchestrates the flow of messages between users and AI avatars. It manages the conversation lifecycle, including message processing, response generation, narrative development, and channel context management.

#### Functionality
- **Response Generation**: Creates context-aware avatar responses to user messages
- **Narrative Generation**: Periodically generates character reflections and development 
- **Channel Context**: Maintains and updates conversation history and summaries
- **Permission Management**: Ensures the bot has necessary channel permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements cooldown mechanisms to prevent response spam

#### Implementation
The ConversationManager extends BasicService and requires several dependencies for its operation. It manages cooldowns, permission checks, and orchestrates the process of generating and sending responses.

```javascript
export class ConversationManager extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'discordService',
      'avatarService',
      'aiService',
    ]);

    this.GLOBAL_NARRATIVE_COOLDOWN = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
    this.lastGlobalNarrativeTime = 0;
    this.channelLastMessage = new Map();
    this.CHANNEL_COOLDOWN = 5 * 1000; // 5 seconds
    this.MAX_RESPONSES_PER_MESSAGE = 2;
    this.channelResponders = new Map();
    this.requiredPermissions = ['ViewChannel', 'SendMessages', 'ReadMessageHistory', 'ManageWebhooks'];
   
    this.db = services.databaseService.getDatabase();
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `generateNarrative(avatar)`
Periodically generates personality development and narrative reflection for an avatar. This enables characters to "think" about their experiences and evolve over time.

#### `getChannelContext(channelId, limit)`
Retrieves recent message history for a channel, using database records when available and falling back to Discord API when needed.

#### `getChannelSummary(avatarId, channelId)`
Maintains and updates AI-generated summaries of channel conversations to provide context without using excessive token count.

#### `sendResponse(channel, avatar)`
Orchestrates the full response generation flow:
1. Checks permissions and cooldowns
2. Gathers context and relevant information
3. Assembles prompts and generates AI response
4. Processes any commands in the response
5. Sends the response to the channel

#### `removeAvatarPrefix(response, avatar)`
Cleans up responses that might include the avatar's name as a prefix.

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
The service implements several rate limiting mechanisms:
- Global narrative cooldown (1 hour)
- Per-channel response cooldown (5 seconds)
- Maximum responses per message (2)

#### Dependencies
- DiscordService: For Discord interactions
- AvatarService: For avatar data and updates
- AIService: For generating AI responses
- DatabaseService: For persistence
- PromptService: For generating structured prompts

#### Message Flow (Sequence Diagram)

This sequence diagram tracks the lifecycle of a user message through the system.

It demonstrates the interaction between different services, showing how a message flows from initial user input to final response. Each message is enriched with historical context from memory, can trigger media generation, and gets archived for future reference. The diagram illustrates how our services work together in real-time, handling everything from chat responses to image creation and data storage.

**Key Features**

- Message routing connects our agents to users across different platforms
- Context from past conversations informs responses
- AI services generate natural, contextual replies
- Dynamic creation of images and media

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### Document: services/core/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies

#### Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)

#### Document: services/core/aiService.md

#### AI Service

#### Overview
The AI Service serves as a facade for underlying AI model providers, enabling the system to switch between different AI services with minimal code changes. It acts as a mediator between the application and external AI providers such as OpenRouter, Google AI, and Ollama.

#### Functionality
- **Provider Selection**: Dynamically selects the appropriate AI service provider based on environment configuration
- **Model Management**: Handles model selection, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery
- **Request Formatting**: Prepares prompts and parameters in the format expected by each provider

#### Implementation
The service uses a factory pattern approach by importing specific provider implementations and exporting the appropriate one based on the `AI_SERVICE` environment variable. If the specified provider is unknown, it defaults to OpenRouterAIService.

```javascript
// Export selection based on environment variable
switch (process.env.AI_SERVICE) {
    case 'google':
        AIService = GoogleAIService;
        break;
    case 'ollama':
        AIService = OllamaService;
        break;
    case 'openrouter':
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
    default:
        console.warn(`Unknown AI_SERVICE: ${process.env.AI_SERVICE}. Defaulting to OpenRouterAIService.`);
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
}
```

#### Provider Implementations
The system includes implementations for multiple AI providers:

#### OpenRouterAIService
- Connects to OpenRouter's API for access to multiple AI models
- Provides chat completions, text completions, and basic image analysis
- Includes random model selection based on rarity tiers
- Handles API errors and implements retries for rate limits

#### GoogleAIService
- Connects to Google's Vertex AI platform
- Provides similar functionality with Google's AI models

#### OllamaService
- Connects to local Ollama instance for self-hosted AI models
- Useful for development or when privacy/cost concerns exist

#### Dependencies
- Basic framework services (logger, etc.)
- OpenAI SDK (for OpenRouter compatibility)
- Google AI SDK (for GoogleAIService)

The ConversationManager orchestrates the flow of messages between users and AI avatars. It manages the conversation lifecycle, including message processing, response generation, narrative development, and channel context management.

#### Functionality
- **Response Generation**: Creates context-aware avatar responses to user messages
- **Narrative Generation**: Periodically generates character reflections and development 
- **Channel Context**: Maintains and updates conversation history and summaries
- **Permission Management**: Ensures the bot has necessary channel permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements cooldown mechanisms to prevent response spam

#### Implementation
The ConversationManager extends BasicService and requires several dependencies for its operation. It manages cooldowns, permission checks, and orchestrates the process of generating and sending responses.

```javascript
export class ConversationManager extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'discordService',
      'avatarService',
      'aiService',
    ]);

    this.GLOBAL_NARRATIVE_COOLDOWN = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
    this.lastGlobalNarrativeTime = 0;
    this.channelLastMessage = new Map();
    this.CHANNEL_COOLDOWN = 5 * 1000; // 5 seconds
    this.MAX_RESPONSES_PER_MESSAGE = 2;
    this.channelResponders = new Map();
    this.requiredPermissions = ['ViewChannel', 'SendMessages', 'ReadMessageHistory', 'ManageWebhooks'];
   
    this.db = services.databaseService.getDatabase();
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `generateNarrative(avatar)`
Periodically generates personality development and narrative reflection for an avatar. This enables characters to "think" about their experiences and evolve over time.

#### `getChannelContext(channelId, limit)`
Retrieves recent message history for a channel, using database records when available and falling back to Discord API when needed.

#### `getChannelSummary(avatarId, channelId)`
Maintains and updates AI-generated summaries of channel conversations to provide context without using excessive token count.
