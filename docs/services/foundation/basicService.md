# Basic Service

## Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

## Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

## Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

## Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)
