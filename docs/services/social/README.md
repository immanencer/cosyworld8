# Social Integrations

This section documents all social media integrations for the Moonstone Sanctum project.

## Available Integrations

- [X (Twitter) Integration](x-integration.md) - Connect avatars to X accounts for posting and interactions
- [Discord Integration](discord-integration.md) - Core communication platform for avatar interactions
- [Telegram Integration](telegram-integration.md) - (Coming soon) Future messaging platform support

## Integration Architecture

Each social integration follows a similar pattern:

1. **Authentication** - OAuth or similar protocol for secure user authorization
2. **Webhook/Event Systems** - For receiving updates from the platform
3. **Message Processing** - Handling incoming messages and generating responses
4. **Content Publishing** - Posting content to the platform programmatically
5. **Rate Limiting** - Managing API quotas and preventing spam

## Common Services

Integrations share several service components:

- `conversationManager` - Context management and response generation
- `promptService` - AI prompt templating and generation
- `messageHandler` - Processing incoming messages
- `toolService` - Platform-specific interaction tools

## Future Plans

Additional platforms under consideration:

- Matrix/Element
- Slack
