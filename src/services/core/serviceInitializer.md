# Service Initializer

## Overview
The ServiceInitializer is responsible for bootstrapping the entire application by initializing all services in the correct order, handling dependencies, and ensuring proper startup of the system.

## Functionality
- **Environment Validation**: Validates required environment variables
- **Service Instantiation**: Creates service instances in dependency order
- **Initialization Sequencing**: Manages the startup sequence of services
- **Error Handling**: Handles initialization failures gracefully
- **Container Integration**: Uses the service container for modern DI patterns

## Implementation
The ServiceInitializer exports an async function that creates and initializes all services:

1. Validates environment variables
2. Creates a services object with a logger
3. Resolves container-based services (BasicService, SchedulingService)
4. Initializes each service in the correct order
5. Connects services to external systems (databases, APIs)
6. Returns a subset of services needed by the application

```javascript
export async function initializeServices(logger) {
  // Validate environment variables
  await validateEnvironment(logger);

  // Initialize services object with logger
  const services = { logger };

  // Resolve container-based services
  try {
    services.basic = container.resolve('basic');
    services.schedulingService = container.resolve('schedulingService');
  } catch (err) {
    logger.warn(`Failed to resolve container services: ${err.message}`);
  }

  // Initialize services in dependency order
  services.databaseService = new DatabaseService(logger);
  await services.databaseService.connect();
  
  // Initialize more services...
  
  return {
    // Return subset of services needed by the application
    discordService: services.discordService,
    databaseService: services.databaseService,
    // ...other services
  };
}
```

## Usage
The ServiceInitializer is used in the main application entry point to boot the system:

```javascript
import { logger } from "./services/foundation/logger.mjs";
import { initializeServices } from "./services/core/serviceInitializer.mjs";

async function main() {
  const services = await initializeServices(logger);
  logger.info("âœ… Application services initialized");
}
```

## Dependencies
- Container and ServiceRegistry
- All service classes used in the application
