## Document: services/x-authentication.md

#### X (Twitter) Authentication and Integration

#### Overview

Moonstone Sanctum includes a comprehensive integration with X (formerly Twitter) that allows avatars to authenticate, link their X accounts, and interact with the X platform programmatically. This document outlines the end-to-end X authentication and linking lifecycle, including technical details and recommended improvements.

#### Authentication Flow

The X authentication system implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) and includes the following main components:

1. **Client-side Integration**: Implemented in `xService.mjs` in the client's code
2. **Server-side Routes**: Implemented in `xauth.mjs` as Express routes
3. **X Social Tools**: Functionality for X social interactions (`XPostTool.mjs` and `XSocialTool.mjs`)

#### Authentication Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant X

    User->>Client: Request X authentication
    Client->>Server: Request auth URL (/api/xauth/auth-url?avatarId=123)
    Server->>Server: Generate state & code verifier
    Server->>Server: Store in x_auth_temp
    Server->>X: Create auth URL
    X-->>Server: Return auth URL
    Server-->>Client: Return auth URL
    Client->>Client: Open popup window with auth URL
    Client-->>User: Show X auth popup
    User->>X: Authorize app
    X->>Server: Redirect to callback URL with code
    Server->>Server: Verify state parameter
    Server->>X: Exchange code for tokens
    X-->>Server: Return access & refresh tokens
    Server->>Server: Store tokens in x_auth collection
    Server-->>Client: Send success message via window.opener
    Client->>Client: Handle auth success
    Client-->>User: Show auth success
```

#### Implementation Details

#### 1. Client-Side Initialization

When a user initiates X authentication:

```javascript
// From src/services/xService.mjs
export async function initiateXAuth(avatarId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/xauth/auth-url?avatarId=${avatarId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Open X authentication popup
  window.open(
    data.url,
    'xauth_popup',
    `width=600,height=650,top=${window.screen.height/2-325},left=${window.screen.width/2-300}`
  );
  
  return { success: true, message: 'X authentication initiated' };
}
```

#### 2. Server-Side Authorization URL Generation

The server handles the request and generates an authorization URL:

```javascript
// From src/services/web/server/routes/xauth.mjs
router.get('/auth-url', async (req, res) => {
  const { avatarId } = req.query;
  
  // Generate state for CSRF protection
  const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
  
  // Create X API client
  const client = new TwitterApi({
    clientId: process.env.X_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.X_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });
  
  // Generate OAuth URL with PKCE
  const { url, codeVerifier } = client.generateOAuth2AuthLink(
    process.env.X_CALLBACK_URL,
    { scope: ['tweet.read', 'tweet.write', 'users.read', 'offline.access'], state }
  );
  
  // Store temporarily for callback verification
  await db.collection('x_auth_temp').insertOne({
    avatarId,
    codeVerifier,
    state,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT),
  });
  
  res.json({ url, state });
});
```

#### 3. OAuth Callback Processing

After the user authorizes the application:

```javascript
router.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code, state } = req.query;
  
  // Find the temporary auth record
  const storedAuth = await db.collection('x_auth_temp').findOne({ state });
  
  // Exchange the code for tokens
  const { accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn } = await client.loginWithOAuth2({
    code,
    codeVerifier: storedAuth.codeVerifier,
    redirectUri: process.env.X_CALLBACK_URL,
  });
  
  // Store tokens in database
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId: storedAuth.avatarId },
    {
      $set: {
        accessToken,
        refreshToken,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + expiresIn * 1000),
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      }
    },
    { upsert: true }
  );
  
  // Close the popup and notify the opener
  res.send(`
    <script>
      window.opener.postMessage({ type: 'X_AUTH_SUCCESS' }, '*');
      window.close();
    </script>
  `);
});
```

#### 4. Wallet Linking

After authentication, users can optionally link their wallet:

```javascript
// Client-side request
export async function connectWalletToXAuth(avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/xauth/connect-wallet', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Server-side handler
router.post('/connect-wallet', async (req, res) => {
  const { avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message } = req.body;
  
  // Verify signature
  if (!verifyWalletSignature(message, signature, walletAddress)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }
  
  // Update X auth record with wallet address
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId },
    { $set: { walletAddress, updatedAt: new Date() } }
  );
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

#### 5. Token Refresh

When tokens expire, the system refreshes them:

```javascript
async function refreshAccessToken(auth) {
  const client = new TwitterApi({
    clientId: process.env.X_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.X_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });
  
  const { accessToken, refreshToken: newRefreshToken, expiresIn } = 
    await client.refreshOAuth2Token(auth.refreshToken);
  
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId: auth.avatarId },
    {
      $set: {
        accessToken,
        refreshToken: newRefreshToken,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + expiresIn * 1000),
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      },
    }
  );
  
  return { accessToken, expiresAt };
}
```

#### 6. X Social Interactions

The system provides X social tools for authenticated avatars:

#### XPostTool
Allows avatars to post to X:

```javascript
// From XPostTool.mjs
async execute(message, params, avatar) {
  // Check auth and retrieve tokens
  const auth = await db.collection('x_auth').findOne({ avatarId: avatar._id.toString() });
  
  // Post to X
  const twitterClient = new TwitterApi(decrypt(auth.accessToken));
  await twitterClient.v2.tweet(messageText);
  
  // Store post record
  await db.collection('social_posts').insertOne({
    avatarId: avatar._id,
    content: messageText,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    postedToX: true
  });
  
  return `‚ú® Posted to X: "${messageText}"`;
}
```

#### XSocialTool
Provides enhanced social interactions with AI-driven actions:

```javascript
// From XSocialTool.mjs - AI-assisted X interactions
async execute(message, params, avatar) {
  if (command === 'auto') {
    // Get context and X timeline data
    const context = await this.getChannelContext(message.channel);
    const { timeline, notifications } = await this.getXTimelineAndNotifications(avatar);
    
    // Generate AI-driven social actions
    const actions = await this.generateSocialActions(avatar, context, timeline, notifications);
    
    // Execute actions
    for (const action of actions.actions) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'post':
          await v2Client.tweet(action.content);
          break;
        case 'reply':
          await v2Client.reply(action.content, action.tweetId);
          break;
        // Additional action types...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Data Storage

The X authentication system uses two MongoDB collections:

1. **x_auth_temp**: Temporary storage for authentication state and PKCE code verifier
   - `avatarId`: The avatar being authenticated
   - `codeVerifier`: PKCE code verifier
   - `state`: Random state for CSRF protection
   - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
   - `expiresAt`: Expiration timestamp (10 minutes)

2. **x_auth**: Permanent storage for X authentication tokens
   - `avatarId`: The authenticated avatar
   - `accessToken`: OAuth access token (should be encrypted)
   - `refreshToken`: OAuth refresh token (should be encrypted)
   - `expiresAt`: Token expiration timestamp
   - `walletAddress`: Associated wallet address (optional)
   - `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp

#### Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security features:

1. **PKCE Flow**: Uses code verifier and challenge for additional security
2. **State Parameter**: Prevents CSRF attacks during the OAuth flow
3. **Token Encryption**: Refresh tokens should be encrypted before storage
4. **Wallet Signature Verification**: Validates wallet ownership for linking
5. **Token Refresh**: Handles token expiration and refresh
6. **Temporary Session Cleanup**: Removes expired authentication sessions

#### Improvement Plan

#### 1. Enhanced Token Security

**Current Status**: The implementation includes token encryption, but it may not be consistently applied across all components.

**Improvements**:
- Ensure all tokens are encrypted at rest using a strong encryption method
- Implement key rotation for encryption keys

   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### 5. Enhanced Configuration Management

```javascript
async fetchImageAsBase64(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch image: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
    if (!contentType || !contentType.startsWith('image/')) {
      throw new Error(`URL doesn't point to an image: ${contentType}`);
    }
    
    const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    return {
      data: Buffer.from(buffer).toString('base64'),
      mimeType: contentType
    };
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Error fetching image from URL: ${error.message}`);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### Generating Image Descriptions
Uses AI vision capabilities to describe image content:

```javascript
async getImageDescription(imageBase64, mimeType) {
  try {
    // Use AI service to get a description of the image
    const response = await this.aiService.chat([
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are an AI that provides concise, detailed descriptions of images. Focus on the main subjects, actions, setting, and important visual elements. Keep descriptions under 100 words."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          { type: "text", text: "Describe this image in detail:" },
          { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: `data:${mimeType};base64,${imageBase64}` } }
        ]
      }
    ]);
    
    return response || "No description available";
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Failed to get image description: ${error.message}`);
    return "Error generating image description";
  }
}
```

#### Extracting Images from Discord Messages
Processes Discord messages to extract all image content:

```javascript
async extractImagesFromMessage(message) {
  const images = [];
  
  try {
    // Process attachments
    if (message.attachments && message.attachments.size > 0) {
      for (const [_, attachment] of message.attachments) {
        if (attachment.contentType && attachment.contentType.startsWith('image/')) {
          // Process image attachment...
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Process embeds that may contain images
    if (message.embeds && message.embeds.length > 0) {
      for (const embed of message.embeds) {
        // Process embed images and thumbnails...
      }
    }
    
    // Process URLs in message content that might be images
    const urlRegex = /(https?:\/\/[^\s]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp))/gi;
    const matches = message.content.match(urlRegex);
    
    if (matches) {
      // Process image URLs...
    }
    
    return images;
  } catch (error) {
    this.logger.error(`Error extracting images from message: ${error.message}`);
    return [];
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- **Logger**: For error tracking and debugging
- **AI Service**: For generating image descriptions using vision capabilities

#### Usage Examples

#### Processing an Image URL

```javascript
const imageService = new ImageProcessingService(logger, aiService);

// Fetch and convert an image
try {
  const imageData = await imageService.fetchImageAsBase64('https://example.com/image.jpg');
  console.log(`Image fetched, MIME type: ${imageData.mimeType}`);
  
  // Generate a description of the image
  const description = await imageService.getImageDescription(
    imageData.data, 
    imageData.mimeType
  );
  
  console.log(`Image description: ${description}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Failed to process image: ${error.message}`);
}
```

#### Handling Discord Message with Images

```javascript
// When a message is received
client.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {
  // Skip non-image messages quickly
  if (!message.attachments.size && !message.embeds.length && !message.content.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)/i)) {
    return;
  }
  
  const imageService = new ImageProcessingService(logger, aiService);
  const images = await imageService.extractImagesFromMessage(message);
  
  if (images.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Found ${images.length} images in the message`);
    
    // Process each image
    for (const image of images) {
      const description = await imageService.getImageDescription(
        image.base64,
        image.mimeType
      );
      
      // Use the description
      await message.reply(`I see: ${description}`);

## Document: services/integration/x-authentication.md

#### X (Twitter) Authentication and Integration

#### Overview

Moonstone Sanctum includes a comprehensive integration with X (formerly Twitter) that allows avatars to authenticate, link their X accounts, and interact with the X platform programmatically. This document outlines the end-to-end X authentication and linking lifecycle, including technical details and recommended improvements.

#### Authentication Flow

The X authentication system implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) and includes the following main components:

1. **Client-side Integration**: Implemented in `xService.mjs` in the client's code
2. **Server-side Routes**: Implemented in `xauth.mjs` as Express routes
3. **X Social Tools**: Functionality for X social interactions (`XPostTool.mjs` and `XSocialTool.mjs`)

#### Authentication Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant X

    User->>Client: Request X authentication
    Client->>Server: Request auth URL (/api/xauth/auth-url?avatarId=123)
    Server->>Server: Generate state & code verifier
    Server->>Server: Store in x_auth_temp
    Server->>X: Create auth URL
    X-->>Server: Return auth URL
    Server-->>Client: Return auth URL
    Client->>Client: Open popup window with auth URL
    Client-->>User: Show X auth popup
    User->>X: Authorize app
    X->>Server: Redirect to callback URL with code
    Server->>Server: Verify state parameter
    Server->>X: Exchange code for tokens
    X-->>Server: Return access & refresh tokens
    Server->>Server: Store tokens in x_auth collection
    Server-->>Client: Send success message via window.opener
    Client->>Client: Handle auth success
    Client-->>User: Show auth success
```

#### Implementation Details

#### 1. Client-Side Initialization

When a user initiates X authentication:

```javascript
// From src/services/xService.mjs
export async function initiateXAuth(avatarId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/xauth/auth-url?avatarId=${avatarId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Open X authentication popup
  window.open(
    data.url,
    'xauth_popup',
    `width=600,height=650,top=${window.screen.height/2-325},left=${window.screen.width/2-300}`
  );
  
  return { success: true, message: 'X authentication initiated' };
}
```

#### 2. Server-Side Authorization URL Generation

The server handles the request and generates an authorization URL:

```javascript
// From src/services/web/server/routes/xauth.mjs
router.get('/auth-url', async (req, res) => {
  const { avatarId } = req.query;
  
  // Generate state for CSRF protection
  const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
  
  // Create X API client
  const client = new TwitterApi({
    clientId: process.env.X_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.X_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });
  
  // Generate OAuth URL with PKCE
  const { url, codeVerifier } = client.generateOAuth2AuthLink(
    process.env.X_CALLBACK_URL,
    { scope: ['tweet.read', 'tweet.write', 'users.read', 'offline.access'], state }
  );
  
  // Store temporarily for callback verification
  await db.collection('x_auth_temp').insertOne({
    avatarId,
    codeVerifier,
    state,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + AUTH_SESSION_TIMEOUT),
  });
  
  res.json({ url, state });
});
```

#### 3. OAuth Callback Processing

After the user authorizes the application:

```javascript
router.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code, state } = req.query;
  
  // Find the temporary auth record
  const storedAuth = await db.collection('x_auth_temp').findOne({ state });
  
  // Exchange the code for tokens
  const { accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn } = await client.loginWithOAuth2({
    code,
    codeVerifier: storedAuth.codeVerifier,
    redirectUri: process.env.X_CALLBACK_URL,
  });
  
  // Store tokens in database
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId: storedAuth.avatarId },
    {
      $set: {
        accessToken,
        refreshToken,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + expiresIn * 1000),
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      }
    },
    { upsert: true }
  );
  
  // Close the popup and notify the opener
  res.send(`
    <script>
      window.opener.postMessage({ type: 'X_AUTH_SUCCESS' }, '*');
      window.close();
    </script>
  `);
});
```

#### 4. Wallet Linking

After authentication, users can optionally link their wallet:

```javascript
// Client-side request
export async function connectWalletToXAuth(avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/xauth/connect-wallet', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Server-side handler
router.post('/connect-wallet', async (req, res) => {
  const { avatarId, walletAddress, signature, message } = req.body;
  
  // Verify signature
  if (!verifyWalletSignature(message, signature, walletAddress)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }
  
  // Update X auth record with wallet address
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId },
    { $set: { walletAddress, updatedAt: new Date() } }
  );
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

#### 5. Token Refresh

When tokens expire, the system refreshes them:

```javascript
async function refreshAccessToken(auth) {
  const client = new TwitterApi({
    clientId: process.env.X_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.X_CLIENT_SECRET,
  });
  
  const { accessToken, refreshToken: newRefreshToken, expiresIn } = 
    await client.refreshOAuth2Token(auth.refreshToken);
  
  await db.collection('x_auth').updateOne(
    { avatarId: auth.avatarId },
    {
      $set: {
        accessToken,
        refreshToken: newRefreshToken,
        expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + expiresIn * 1000),
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      },
    }
  );
  
  return { accessToken, expiresAt };
}
```

#### 6. X Social Interactions

The system provides X social tools for authenticated avatars:

#### XPostTool
Allows avatars to post to X:

```javascript
// From XPostTool.mjs
async execute(message, params, avatar) {
  // Check auth and retrieve tokens
  const auth = await db.collection('x_auth').findOne({ avatarId: avatar._id.toString() });
  
  // Post to X
  const twitterClient = new TwitterApi(decrypt(auth.accessToken));
  await twitterClient.v2.tweet(messageText);
  
  // Store post record
  await db.collection('social_posts').insertOne({
    avatarId: avatar._id,
    content: messageText,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    postedToX: true
  });
  
  return `‚ú® Posted to X: "${messageText}"`;
}
```

#### XSocialTool
Provides enhanced social interactions with AI-driven actions:

```javascript
// From XSocialTool.mjs - AI-assisted X interactions
async execute(message, params, avatar) {
  if (command === 'auto') {
    // Get context and X timeline data
    const context = await this.getChannelContext(message.channel);
    const { timeline, notifications } = await this.getXTimelineAndNotifications(avatar);
    
    // Generate AI-driven social actions
    const actions = await this.generateSocialActions(avatar, context, timeline, notifications);
    
    // Execute actions
    for (const action of actions.actions) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'post':
          await v2Client.tweet(action.content);
          break;
        case 'reply':
          await v2Client.reply(action.content, action.tweetId);
          break;
        // Additional action types...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Data Storage

The X authentication system uses two MongoDB collections:

1. **x_auth_temp**: Temporary storage for authentication state and PKCE code verifier
   - `avatarId`: The avatar being authenticated
   - `codeVerifier`: PKCE code verifier
   - `state`: Random state for CSRF protection
   - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
   - `expiresAt`: Expiration timestamp (10 minutes)

2. **x_auth**: Permanent storage for X authentication tokens
   - `avatarId`: The authenticated avatar
   - `accessToken`: OAuth access token (should be encrypted)
   - `refreshToken`: OAuth refresh token (should be encrypted)
   - `expiresAt`: Token expiration timestamp
   - `walletAddress`: Associated wallet address (optional)
   - `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp

#### Security Considerations

The implementation includes several security features:

1. **PKCE Flow**: Uses code verifier and challenge for additional security
2. **State Parameter**: Prevents CSRF attacks during the OAuth flow
3. **Token Encryption**: Refresh tokens should be encrypted before storage
4. **Wallet Signature Verification**: Validates wallet ownership for linking
5. **Token Refresh**: Handles token expiration and refresh
6. **Temporary Session Cleanup**: Removes expired authentication sessions

#### Improvement Plan

#### 1. Enhanced Token Security

**Current Status**: The implementation includes token encryption, but it may not be consistently applied across all components.

**Improvements**:
- Ensure all tokens are encrypted at rest using a strong encryption method
- Implement key rotation for encryption keys
- Add a salt to each token's encryption to prevent rainbow table attacks

#### 2. Improved Error Handling

**Current Status**: Basic error handling exists but could be more comprehensive.

**Improvements**:
- Add more detailed error logging with correlation IDs
- Implement more graceful degradation when X API is unavailable
- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Create a dashboard for monitoring authentication failures

#### 3. User Experience Enhancements

**Current Status**: Basic authentication flow with popup windows.

**Improvements**:
- Add a modal progress indicator during authentication
- Implement silent token refresh when possible
- Add clearer error messages for users
- Provide visual indicators of X connection status
- Add a "reconnect" option when tokens are expired but refresh tokens are invalid

#### 4. Rate Limiting and Quotas

**Current Status**: No explicit handling of X API rate limits.

**Improvements**:
- Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent quota exhaustion
- Add a queue system for high-volume posting scenarios
- Implement backoff strategies for rate limit errors
- Add monitoring for quota usage

#### 5. Enhanced X Features

**Current Status**: Basic posting, replying, and timeline viewing.

**Improvements**:
- Add support for media uploads (images, videos)
- Implement thread creation capabilities
- Add analytics for X engagement

## Document: services/foundation/logger.md

#### Logger Service

#### Overview
The Logger Service provides consistent, formatted logging capabilities throughout the CosyWorld system. It uses Winston, a versatile logging library for Node.js, to output formatted logs to both the console and log files, enabling effective debugging and system monitoring.

#### Functionality
- **Multi-transport Logging**: Outputs logs to both console and file
- **Formatted Output**: Provides structured, readable log formats
- **Log Levels**: Supports different log levels (info, warn, error, debug)
- **Timestamp Integration**: Automatically adds timestamps to all log entries
- **Colorized Console Output**: Enhances readability in terminal sessions

#### Implementation
The Logger Service is implemented as a Winston logger instance with customized formatting:

```javascript
import winston from 'winston';

const { combine, timestamp, printf, colorize, json } = winston.format;

// Pretty log format for console
const consoleFormat = printf(({ level, message, timestamp }) => {
  return `[${timestamp}] ${level}: ${message}`;
});

export const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: combine(
    timestamp({ format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss' }),
    json() // File format stays clean
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: combine(
        colorize(),
        timestamp({ format: 'HH:mm:ss' }),
        consoleFormat
      )
    }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ],
});
```

#### Log Formats

#### Console Output
The console format is optimized for readability during development:
- Colorized by log level (info, warn, error)
- Compact timestamp (HH:mm:ss)
- Clean, single-line output

Example: `[14:27:35] info: Avatar 'Mage' created successfully`

#### File Output
The file format is optimized for parsing and analysis:
- JSON structure for programmatic consumption
- Full timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss)
- Complete metadata preservation

Example:
```json
{"level":"info","message":"Avatar 'Mage' created successfully","timestamp":"2023-05-20 14:27:35"}
```

#### Usage
The logger is exported as a singleton instance that can be imported and used throughout the application:

```javascript
import { logger } from './logger.mjs';

// Different log levels
logger.info('System initialized');
logger.warn('Resource running low');
logger.error('Failed to connect to database', { error: err.message });
logger.debug('Processing step completed', { step: 'validation', result: 'success' });
```

#### Log Levels
The logger supports the standard Winston log levels, in order of priority:
1. **error**: Critical errors requiring immediate attention
2. **warn**: Warnings that don't prevent operation but require attention
3. **info**: General operational information (default level)
4. **verbose**: Detailed information for troubleshooting
5. **debug**: Low-level debugging information
6. **silly**: Extremely detailed debugging information

#### Best Practices
- Use appropriate log levels for different types of messages
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use structured logging for machine-parseable events
- Avoid logging sensitive information (tokens, passwords)
- Keep log messages concise and meaningful
- Use error objects for stack traces when logging errors

#### Customization
The logger can be customized by modifying its configuration:

- **Changing log levels**: Adjust verbosity based on environment
- **Adding transports**: Integrate with log aggregation services
- **Custom formats**: Tailor output for specific needs
- **Rotation policies**: Manage log file growth and archiving

#### Integration Points
The logger integrates with various parts of the system:
- **Service initialization**: Track service startup and configuration
- **Request handling**: Log incoming requests and responses
- **Error handling**: Capture and log exceptions
- **Performance monitoring**: Track timing and resource usage
- **Security events**: Log authentication and authorization activities

## Document: services/foundation/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)

- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)

## Document: services/blockchain/tokenService.md

#### Token Service

#### Overview
The Token Service provides a complete interface for creating and managing blockchain tokens on the Solana network. It integrates with the Moonshot SDK to facilitate token creation, transaction management, and wallet interactions, abstracting away the complexities of blockchain development.

#### Functionality
- **Token Creation**: Generates new tokens with customizable parameters (name, symbol, description, icons)
- **Transaction Preparation**: Creates and prepares mint transactions for user signing
- **Transaction Submission**: Submits signed transactions to the blockchain
- **Parameter Validation**: Ensures all token parameters meet platform requirements
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for blockchain interactions

#### Implementation
The service implements a facade pattern over the Moonshot SDK, providing a simplified interface for token operations. It initializes with the appropriate blockchain environment based on configuration settings:

```javascript
export class TokenService {
  constructor() {
    this.rpcUrl = process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL || 'https://api.devnet.solana.com';
    this.moonshot = new Moonshot({
      rpcUrl: this.rpcUrl,
      environment: Environment.DEVNET,
      chainOptions: {
        solana: { confirmOptions: { commitment: 'confirmed' } },
      },
    });
  }
}
```

#### Token Creation Process
The token creation follows a two-step process:

1. **Prepare Mint**: Sets up the token parameters and prepares the transaction
   ```javascript
   async createToken({ name, symbol, description, icon, banner, walletAddress }) {
     // Validate parameters
     if (!name || !symbol || !description || !icon || !banner || !walletAddress) {
       throw new Error('Missing required token parameters');
     }
     
     // Normalize symbol
     symbol = symbol.substring(0, 4).toUpperCase();
     
     // Prepare mint params
     const mintParams = {
       creator: walletAddress,
       name,
       symbol,
       curveType: CurveType.CONSTANT_PRODUCT_V1,
       migrationDex: MigrationDex.RAYDIUM,
       icon,
       description,
       links: [{ url: 'https://www.moonstone-sanctum.com', label: 'Website' }],
       banner,
       tokenAmount: '42000000000',
     };
     
     const prepMint = await this.moonshot.prepareMintTx(mintParams);
     return prepMint;
   }
   ```

2. **Submit Signed Transaction**: After user signing, submit the transaction to the network
   ```javascript
   async submitSignedTransaction(signedTx, tokenId) {
     const res = await this.moonshot.submitMintTx({
       tokenId,
       signedTransaction: signedTx
     });
     return res;
   }
   ```

#### Dependencies
- **Moonshot SDK**: External dependency for Solana token operations
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `SOLANA_RPC_URL`: URL for the Solana network RPC endpoint
- **Solana Web3.js**: For blockchain interactions

#### Integration
The TokenService integrates with other system components:

1. **Web Routes**: Exposed through the web service for frontend interaction
2. **Avatar Service**: For associating tokens with avatars
3. **Web3 Wallet**: For transaction signing by users

#### Usage Examples

#### Creating a New Token
```javascript
// In a web route or other service
const tokenService = new TokenService();

// Step 1: Prepare the token
const tokenPrep = await tokenService.createToken({
  name: "Moonstone",
  symbol: "MOON",
  description: "The official token for Moonstone Sanctum",
  icon: "https://example.com/icon.png",
  banner: "https://example.com/banner.png",
  walletAddress: "8dHEEnEajfcgRRb2KfYAqjLrc1EceBe3YfKUEn1WcJCX"
});

// Returns token data including tokenId for the client to sign
// Frontend handles signing process

// Step 2: Submit signed transaction
const result = await tokenService.submitSignedTransaction(
  signedTransactionBase64,
  tokenPrep.tokenId
);
```

#### Error Handling
The service implements comprehensive error handling with informative messages:

```javascript
try {
  // Token operation
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error creating token:', {
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    name: error.name
  });
  
  if (error.response) {
    console.error('API Response:', {
      status: error.response.status,
      data: error.response.data
    });
  }
  
  throw new Error(`Failed to create token: ${error.message}`);
}
```

The OpenRouter AI Service provides access to a wide variety of AI models from different providers through the OpenRouter API. This service serves as the default AI provider for the system, offering robust capabilities, model fallback mechanisms, and flexible configuration options.

#### Functionality
- **Multiple Model Access**: Single interface to access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and other providers
- **Random Model Selection**: Tiered model selection based on rarity categories
- **Chat Completions**: Process multi-turn conversations with context
- **Text Completions**: Generate text from prompts
- **Model Fallback**: Automatic fallback to alternative models when requested models are unavailable
- **Fuzzy Model Matching**: Find similar model names when exact matches aren't found

#### Implementation
The service extends `BasicService` and uses the OpenAI SDK configured to connect to OpenRouter's API endpoint. It implements model selection logic, rarity-based randomization, and comprehensive error handling.

```javascript
// Initialization in the service
this.openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: this.configService.config.ai.openrouter.apiKey,
  baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1',
  defaultHeaders: {
    'HTTP-Referer': 'https://ratimics.com',
    'X-Title': 'rativerse',
  },
});
```

#### Model Selection System
The service implements a D20-based random model selection system that categorizes models by rarity:
- Common (60%): Rolls 1-12
- Uncommon (25%): Rolls 13-17
- Rare (10%): Rolls 18-19
- Legendary (5%): Roll 20

This system adds variety to AI responses and allows for occasional use of more powerful (and potentially more expensive) models.

#### Rarity-Based Model Selection
```javascript
async selectRandomModel() {
  // Roll a d20 to determine rarity tier
  const roll = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 20);
  
  // Select rarity based on roll ranges
  const selectedRarity = rarityRanges.find(
    range => roll >= range.min && roll <= range.max
  )?.rarity;
  
  // Filter and return random model from that tier
  const availableModels = this.modelConfig.filter(
    model => model.rarity === selectedRarity
  );
  
  if (availableModels.length > 0) {
    return availableModels[Math.floor(Math.random() * availableModels.length)].model;
  }
  return this.model; // Fallback to default
}
```

#### Configuration Options
The service provides default configurations for different types of completions:

#### Chat Defaults
```javascript
this.defaultChatOptions = {
  model: 'meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct',
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 1000,
  top_p: 1.0,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  presence_penalty: 0,
};
```

#### Completion Defaults
```javascript
this.defaultCompletionOptions = {
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 1000,
  top_p: 1.0,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  presence_penalty: 0,
};
```

#### Vision Defaults
```javascript
this.defaultVisionOptions = {
  model: 'x-ai/grok-2-vision-1212',
  temperature: 0.5,
  max_tokens: 200,
};
```

#### Error Handling and Retries
The service implements a robust retry mechanism for rate limit errors:
- Automatic retry after a 5-second delay

## Document: services/ai/aiService.md

#### AI Service

#### Overview
The AI Service serves as a facade for underlying AI model providers, enabling the system to switch between different AI services with minimal code changes. It acts as a mediator between the application and external AI providers such as OpenRouter, Google AI, and Ollama.

#### Functionality
- **Provider Selection**: Dynamically selects the appropriate AI service provider based on environment configuration
- **Model Management**: Handles model selection, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery
- **Request Formatting**: Prepares prompts and parameters in the format expected by each provider

#### Implementation
The service uses a factory pattern approach by importing specific provider implementations and exporting the appropriate one based on the `AI_SERVICE` environment variable. If the specified provider is unknown, it defaults to OpenRouterAIService.

```javascript
// Export selection based on environment variable
switch (process.env.AI_SERVICE) {
    case 'google':
        AIService = GoogleAIService;
        break;
    case 'ollama':
        AIService = OllamaService;
        break;
    case 'openrouter':
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
    default:
        console.warn(`Unknown AI_SERVICE: ${process.env.AI_SERVICE}. Defaulting to OpenRouterAIService.`);
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;

#### Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### 5. Enhanced Configuration Management

#### Document: services/tools/toolService.md

#### Tool Service

#### Overview
The ToolService manages the game mechanics and interactive capabilities of the system through a collection of specialized tools. It acts as a central registry for all gameplay tools, processes commands from AI avatars, and coordinates tool execution with appropriate logging.

#### Functionality
- **Tool Registry**: Maintains a collection of available tools and their emoji triggers
- **Command Processing**: Extracts and processes tool commands from avatar messages
- **Action Logging**: Records all tool usage for history and context
- **Dynamic Creation**: Handles creation of game entities when no specific tool matches

#### Implementation
The ToolService extends BasicService and initializes with a suite of specialized tool classes. Each tool is registered with both a name and, optionally, an emoji trigger that can be used in messages.

```javascript
export class ToolService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'locationService',
      'avatarService',
      'itemService',
      'discordService',
      'databaseService',
      'configService',
      'mapService',
    ]);
    
    // Initialize tool registry
    this.tools = new Map();
    this.toolEmojis = new Map();

    // Register tools
    const toolClasses = {
      summon: SummonTool,
      breed: BreedTool,
      attack: AttackTool,
      defend: DefendTool,
      move: MoveTool,
      remember: RememberTool,
      create: CreationTool,
      xpost: XPostTool,
      item: ItemTool,

export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);

}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `generateNarrative(avatar)`
Periodically generates personality development and narrative reflection for an avatar. This enables characters to "think" about their experiences and evolve over time.

#### `getChannelContext(channelId, limit)`
Retrieves recent message history for a channel, using database records when available and falling back to Discord API when needed.

#### `getChannelSummary(avatarId, channelId)`
Maintains and updates AI-generated summaries of channel conversations to provide context without using excessive token count.

#### `sendResponse(channel, avatar)`
Orchestrates the full response generation flow:
1. Checks permissions and cooldowns
2. Gathers context and relevant information
3. Assembles prompts and generates AI response
4. Processes any commands in the response
5. Sends the response to the channel

#### `removeAvatarPrefix(response, avatar)`
Cleans up responses that might include the avatar's name as a prefix.

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
The service implements several rate limiting mechanisms:
- Global narrative cooldown (1 hour)
- Per-channel response cooldown (5 seconds)
- Maximum responses per message (2)

#### Dependencies
- DiscordService: For Discord interactions
- AvatarService: For avatar data and updates
- AIService: For generating AI responses
- DatabaseService: For persistence
- PromptService: For generating structured prompts

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

```javascript
extractToolCommands(text) {
  if (!text) return { commands: [], cleanText: '', commandLines: [] };

  const lines = text.split('\n');
  const commands = [];
  const commandLines = [];
  const narrativeLines = [];

  for (const line of lines) {
    const trimmedLine = line.trim();
    let isCommand = false;
    for (const [emoji, toolName] of this.toolEmojis.entries()) {
      if (trimmedLine.startsWith(emoji)) {
        const rest = trimmedLine.slice(emoji.length).trim();
        const params = rest ? rest.split(/\s+/) : [];
        commands.push({ command: toolName, emoji, params });
        commandLines.push(line);
        isCommand = true;
        break;

#### Document: services/core/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies

#### Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### 5. Enhanced Configuration Management

#### Document: services/core/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {

- **Breeding**: Facilitates creation of new avatars from parent traits
- **Media Management**: Handles avatar images and other media

#### Implementation
The AvatarService extends BasicService and works closely with the database to persist avatar data. It interfaces with AI services for generating personality traits and with image services for visual representations.

```javascript
export class AvatarService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'databaseService',
      'aiService',
      'imageProcessingService',
      'configService',
    ]);
    
    this.db = this.databaseService.getDatabase();
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Document: services/core/aiService.md

#### AI Service

#### Overview
The AI Service serves as a facade for underlying AI model providers, enabling the system to switch between different AI services with minimal code changes. It acts as a mediator between the application and external AI providers such as OpenRouter, Google AI, and Ollama.

#### Functionality
- **Provider Selection**: Dynamically selects the appropriate AI service provider based on environment configuration
- **Model Management**: Handles model selection, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery
- **Request Formatting**: Prepares prompts and parameters in the format expected by each provider

#### Implementation
The service uses a factory pattern approach by importing specific provider implementations and exporting the appropriate one based on the `AI_SERVICE` environment variable. If the specified provider is unknown, it defaults to OpenRouterAIService.

```javascript
// Export selection based on environment variable
switch (process.env.AI_SERVICE) {
    case 'google':
        AIService = GoogleAIService;
        break;
    case 'ollama':
        AIService = OllamaService;
        break;
    case 'openrouter':
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
    default:
        console.warn(`Unknown AI_SERVICE: ${process.env.AI_SERVICE}. Defaulting to OpenRouterAIService.`);
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
}
```

#### Provider Implementations
The system includes implementations for multiple AI providers:

#### OpenRouterAIService
- Connects to OpenRouter's API for access to multiple AI models
- Provides chat completions, text completions, and basic image analysis
- Includes random model selection based on rarity tiers
- Handles API errors and implements retries for rate limits

#### GoogleAIService
- Connects to Google's Vertex AI platform
- Provides similar functionality with Google's AI models

#### OllamaService
- Connects to local Ollama instance for self-hosted AI models
- Useful for development or when privacy/cost concerns exist

#### Dependencies
- Basic framework services (logger, etc.)
- OpenAI SDK (for OpenRouter compatibility)
- Google AI SDK (for GoogleAIService)

#### Document: services/chat/conversationManager.md

#### Conversation Manager

#### Overview
The ConversationManager orchestrates the flow of messages between users and AI avatars. It manages the conversation lifecycle, including message processing, response generation, narrative development, and channel context management.

#### Functionality
- **Response Generation**: Creates context-aware avatar responses to user messages
- **Narrative Generation**: Periodically generates character reflections and development 
- **Channel Context**: Maintains and updates conversation history and summaries
- **Permission Management**: Ensures the bot has necessary channel permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements cooldown mechanisms to prevent response spam

#### Implementation
The ConversationManager extends BasicService and requires several dependencies for its operation. It manages cooldowns, permission checks, and orchestrates the process of generating and sending responses.

```javascript
export class ConversationManager extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, [
      'discordService',
      'avatarService',
      'aiService',
    ]);

    this.GLOBAL_NARRATIVE_COOLDOWN = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
    this.lastGlobalNarrativeTime = 0;
    this.channelLastMessage = new Map();
    this.CHANNEL_COOLDOWN = 5 * 1000; // 5 seconds
    this.MAX_RESPONSES_PER_MESSAGE = 2;
    this.channelResponders = new Map();
    this.requiredPermissions = ['ViewChannel', 'SendMessages', 'ReadMessageHistory', 'ManageWebhooks'];
   
    this.db = services.databaseService.getDatabase();
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `generateNarrative(avatar)`
Periodically generates personality development and narrative reflection for an avatar. This enables characters to "think" about their experiences and evolve over time.

#### `getChannelContext(channelId, limit)`
Retrieves recent message history for a channel, using database records when available and falling back to Discord API when needed.

#### `getChannelSummary(avatarId, channelId)`
Maintains and updates AI-generated summaries of channel conversations to provide context without using excessive token count.

#### `sendResponse(channel, avatar)`
Orchestrates the full response generation flow:
1. Checks permissions and cooldowns
2. Gathers context and relevant information
3. Assembles prompts and generates AI response
4. Processes any commands in the response
5. Sends the response to the channel

#### `removeAvatarPrefix(response, avatar)`
Cleans up responses that might include the avatar's name as a prefix.

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
The service implements several rate limiting mechanisms:
- Global narrative cooldown (1 hour)
- Per-channel response cooldown (5 seconds)
- Maximum responses per message (2)

#### Dependencies
- DiscordService: For Discord interactions
- AvatarService: For avatar data and updates
- AIService: For generating AI responses
- DatabaseService: For persistence
- PromptService: For generating structured prompts

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

      'locationService',
      'avatarService',
      'itemService',
      'discordService',
      'databaseService',
      'configService',
      'mapService',
    ]);
    
    // Initialize tool registry
    this.tools = new Map();
    this.toolEmojis = new Map();

    // Register tools
    const toolClasses = {
      summon: SummonTool,
      breed: BreedTool,
      attack: AttackTool,
      defend: DefendTool,
      move: MoveTool,
      remember: RememberTool,
      create: CreationTool,
      xpost: XPostTool,
      item: ItemTool,
      respond: ThinkTool,
    };

    Object.entries(toolClasses).forEach(([name, ToolClass]) => {
      const tool = new ToolClass(this.services);
      this.tools.set(name, tool);
      if (tool.emoji) this.toolEmojis.set(tool.emoji, name);
    });
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
  
  // Methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `extractToolCommands(text)`
Parses a text message to identify and extract tool commands based on emoji triggers. Returns both the commands and a cleaned version of the text.

```javascript
extractToolCommands(text) {
  if (!text) return { commands: [], cleanText: '', commandLines: [] };

  const lines = text.split('\n');
  const commands = [];
  const commandLines = [];
  const narrativeLines = [];

  for (const line of lines) {
    const trimmedLine = line.trim();
    let isCommand = false;
    for (const [emoji, toolName] of this.toolEmojis.entries()) {
      if (trimmedLine.startsWith(emoji)) {
        const rest = trimmedLine.slice(emoji.length).trim();
        const params = rest ? rest.split(/\s+/) : [];
        commands.push({ command: toolName, emoji, params });
        commandLines.push(line);
        isCommand = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!isCommand) narrativeLines.push(line);
  }

  return { commands, text, commandLines };
}
```

#### `getCommandsDescription(guildId)`
Generates a formatted description of all available commands for a given guild, including syntax and descriptions.

#### `processAction(message, command, params, avatar)`
Executes a tool command with the given parameters and handles success/failure logging. If the command doesn't match a known tool, it uses the CreationTool as a fallback.

The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies

#### Document: services/architecture-report.md

#### CosyWorld Architecture Report

#### Executive Summary

CosyWorld is a sophisticated AI ecosystem built around a service-oriented architecture that enables AI-driven avatar interactions in a rich, evolving environment. The system combines multiple AI models, database persistence, Discord integration, and specialized subsystems to create an immersive experience.

This report analyzes the current architecture, identifies key design patterns, highlights strengths and challenges, and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### System Architecture Overview

The CosyWorld architecture follows a modular, service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns:

#### Core Services Layer
- **BasicService**: Foundation class providing dependency injection, service registration, and lifecycle management
- **DatabaseService**: Manages data persistence using MongoDB and provides fallback mechanisms for development
- **ConfigService**: Centralizes system configuration and environment variables
- **AIService**: Abstracts AI model providers (OpenRouter, Google AI, Ollama) behind a consistent interface
- **PromptService**: Constructs AI prompts from various contextual elements

#### Domain-Specific Services Layer
- **Chat Services**: Manage conversations, message flow, and response generation
- **Tool Services**: Implement gameplay mechanics and interactive capabilities
- **Location Services**: Handle spatial aspects of the environment including maps and positioning
- **Avatar Services**: Manage avatar creation, evolution, and personality
- **Item Services**: Implement inventory, item creation and usage
- **Memory Services**: Handle short and long-term memory for AI entities

#### Integration Layer
- **DiscordService**: Interfaces with Discord for user interaction
- **WebService**: Provides web-based interfaces and APIs
- **S3Service**: Manages external storage for media and data
- **XService**: Enables Twitter/X integration

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Locator/Dependency Injection**
   - Implementation via `BasicService` provides a foundational dependency management pattern
   - Services are registered and initialized in a controlled sequence
   - Dependencies are explicitly declared and validated

2. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Used for services requiring single instances across the system (e.g., DatabaseService)
   - Ensures resource sharing and consistency

3. **Facade Pattern**
   - AIService provides a consistent interface across different AI providers
   - Isolates implementation details of external dependencies

4. **Command Pattern**
   - ToolService implements commands as standalone objects with a consistent interface
   - Allows for dynamic command registration and processing

5. **Observer Pattern**
   - Event-based communication between services, particularly for avatar movements and state changes

#### Strengths of Current Architecture

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
   - Services can be developed, tested, and replaced independently

2. **Adaptability to Different AI Providers**
   - Abstraction allows for switching between different AI models and providers
   - Resilience through fallback mechanisms

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error recovery in critical services
   - Graceful degradation in development environments

4. **Context Management**
   - Sophisticated prompt construction for rich context
   - Tiered memory system balancing recency and relevance

5. **Extensibility**
   - New tools and capabilities can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Service-based architecture supports new integrations

#### Challenges and Areas for Improvement

1. **Initialization Complexity**
   - Service initialization is verbose and potentially fragile
   - Circular dependencies could cause subtle issues

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some services use console logging, others use the logger service
   - Error recovery strategies vary between services

3. **Duplication in Prompt Management**
   - Some prompt construction logic exists in both ConversationManager and PromptService
   - Potential for divergence and inconsistency

4. **Limited Testing Infrastructure**
   - No evident test framework or comprehensive testing strategy
   - Reliance on manual testing increases risk during changes

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Heavy reliance on environment variables
   - Limited validation of configuration values

6. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Minimal inline documentation in some services
   - Service interactions not fully documented

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. Service Initialization Refactoring
- **Implement a Dependency Graph** to manage service initialization order
- **Create a ServiceContainer** class to formalize the service locator pattern
- **Automated Dependency Validation** to detect circular dependencies

```javascript
// Example ServiceContainer implementation
class ServiceContainer {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
    this.dependencyGraph = new Map();
  }
  
  register(name, ServiceClass, dependencies = []) {
    this.dependencyGraph.set(name, dependencies);
    return this;
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Topological sort of dependencies
    const order = this.resolveDependencies();
    
    // Initialize in correct order
    for (const serviceName of order) {
      await this.initializeService(serviceName);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Create an ErrorHandlingService** to centralize error handling strategies
- **Implement Consistent Error Types** with specific recovery actions
- **Add Error Reporting** to track errors across the system

```javascript
// Example ErrorHandlingService
class ErrorHandlingService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
    this.errorCounts = new Map();
  }
  
  handleError(error, context, recovery) {
    this.logError(error, context);
    this.trackError(error);
    return this.executeRecovery(recovery, error);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Prompt Management Consolidation
- **Move All Prompt Logic** to PromptService
- **Implement Versioned Prompts** to track prompt evolution
- **Create Prompt Testing Framework** to evaluate prompt effectiveness

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Implement Unit Testing** for core services
- **Create Integration Tests** for service interactions
- **Develop Simulation Environment** for AI behavior testing

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('PromptService', () => {
  let promptService;
  let mockServices;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockServices = {
      logger: createMockLogger(),
      avatarService: createMockAvatarService(),
      // Other dependencies
    };
    promptService = new PromptService(mockServices);
  });
  
  test('getBasicSystemPrompt returns expected format', async () => {
    const avatar = createTestAvatar();
    const prompt = await promptService.getBasicSystemPrompt(avatar);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.name);
    expect(prompt).toContain(avatar.personality);
  });
});
```

#### 5. Enhanced Configuration Management
- **Implement Schema Validation** for configuration values
- **Create Configuration Presets** for different environments
- **Add Runtime Configuration Updates** for dynamic settings

#### 6. Documentation Enhancement

Retrieves recent memories for an avatar, optionally filtered by query criteria.

#### `searchMemories(avatarId, searchText)`
Searches an avatar's memories for specific content or keywords.

#### `generateMemoryFromText(avatarId, text)`
Uses AI to extract and formulate memories from conversation text.

#### `deleteMemory(memoryId)`
Removes a specific memory from an avatar's history.

#### Memory Structure
Each memory includes:
- `avatarId`: The owner of the memory
- `memory`: The actual memory content
- `timestamp`: When the memory was formed
- `importance`: A numerical rating of significance (1-10)
- `tags`: Categorization labels for filtering
- `context`: Associated information (location, participants, etc.)
- `source`: How the memory was formed (explicit, conversation, etc.)

#### Document: services/core/databaseService.md

#### Database Service

#### Overview
The DatabaseService provides centralized database connectivity, management, and operations for the entire system. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure only one database connection exists throughout the application lifecycle.

#### Functionality
- **Connection Management**: Establishes and maintains MongoDB connections
- **Mock Database**: Provides a fallback in-memory database for development
- **Index Creation**: Creates and maintains database indexes for performance
- **Reconnection Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for failed connections
- **Development Mode Support**: Special handling for development environments

#### Implementation
The service uses a singleton pattern to ensure only one database connection exists at any time. It provides graceful fallbacks for development environments and handles connection failures with reconnection logic.

```javascript
export class DatabaseService {
  static instance = null;

  constructor(logger) {
    if (DatabaseService.instance) {
      return DatabaseService.instance;
    }

    this.logger = logger;
    this.dbClient = null;
    this.db = null;
    this.connected = false;
    this.reconnectDelay = 5000;
    this.dbName = process.env.MONGO_DB_NAME || 'moonstone';

    DatabaseService.instance = this;
  }

  // Additional methods...
}
```

#### Key Methods

#### `connect()`
Establishes a connection to MongoDB using environment variables. If in development mode and connection fails, it falls back to an in-memory mock database.

#### `getDatabase()`
Returns the current database instance. If not connected, schedules a reconnection attempt without blocking.

#### `waitForConnection()`
Provides a promise-based way to wait for database connection with configurable retries and delays.

#### `createIndexes()`
Creates necessary database indexes for collections to ensure query performance.

#### `setupMockDatabase()`
Creates an in-memory mock database for development and testing purposes when a real MongoDB connection isn't available.

#### Database Schema
The service automatically creates and maintains several key collections:

- `messages`: User and avatar messages with indexing on username, timestamp, etc.
- `avatars`: Avatar data with various indexes for quick lookup
- `dungeon_stats`: Character statistics for dungeon gameplay
- `narratives`: Avatar narrative history for memory and personality development
- `memories`: Long-term memory storage for avatars
- `dungeon_log`: Action log for dungeon events and interactions
- `x_auth`: Authentication data for Twitter/X integration
- `social_posts`: Social media posts created by avatars

#### Dependencies
- MongoDB client
- Logger service for logging database operations and errors
- Environment variables for connection details

#### Document: services/core/basicService.md

#### Basic Service

#### Overview
The BasicService serves as the foundation class for all services in the system. It provides a consistent structure and dependency management framework that all other services extend. This service implements core functionality like service registration, initialization, and logging.

#### Functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Manages service dependencies in a consistent way
- **Service Registration**: Validates and registers required services
- **Service Initialization**: Provides standardized service initialization flow
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling for missing dependencies

#### Implementation
The BasicService uses a constructor-based dependency injection pattern where services are passed in and registered. It enforces requirements for dependencies and provides a standard method to initialize dependent services.

```javascript
export class BasicService {
  constructor(services = {}, requiredServices = []) {
    this.logger = services.logger
     || (()=> { throw new Error("Logger service is missing.")});

    this.services = services;
    this.registerServices(requiredServices);
  }

  async initializeServices() {
    // Initialize services that depend on this service.
    for (const serviceName of Object.keys(this.services)) {
      if (this.services[serviceName].initialize && !this.services[serviceName].initialized) {
        this.logger.info(`Initializing service: ${serviceName}`);
        await this.services[serviceName].initialize();
        this.services[serviceName].initialized = true;
        this.logger.info(`Service initialized: ${serviceName}`);
      }
    }
  }

  registerServices(serviceList) {
    serviceList.forEach(element => {
      if (!this.services[element]) {
        throw new Error(`Required service ${element} is missing.`);
      }
      this[element] = this.services[element];
    });
  }
}
```

#### Usage
All service classes should extend BasicService and call the parent constructor with their dependencies. The `requiredServices` array specifies which services must be present for this service to function correctly.

```javascript
export class MyService extends BasicService {
  constructor(services) {
    super(services, ['databaseService', 'configService']);
    
    // Additional initialization...
  }
}
```

#### Dependencies
- Logger service (required for all BasicService instances)

#### Document: services/core/aiService.md

#### AI Service

#### Overview
The AI Service serves as a facade for underlying AI model providers, enabling the system to switch between different AI services with minimal code changes. It acts as a mediator between the application and external AI providers such as OpenRouter, Google AI, and Ollama.

#### Functionality
- **Provider Selection**: Dynamically selects the appropriate AI service provider based on environment configuration
- **Model Management**: Handles model selection, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery
- **Request Formatting**: Prepares prompts and parameters in the format expected by each provider

#### Implementation
The service uses a factory pattern approach by importing specific provider implementations and exporting the appropriate one based on the `AI_SERVICE` environment variable. If the specified provider is unknown, it defaults to OpenRouterAIService.

```javascript
// Export selection based on environment variable
switch (process.env.AI_SERVICE) {
    case 'google':
        AIService = GoogleAIService;
        break;
    case 'ollama':
        AIService = OllamaService;
        break;
    case 'openrouter':
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
    default:
        console.warn(`Unknown AI_SERVICE: ${process.env.AI_SERVICE}. Defaulting to OpenRouterAIService.`);
        AIService = OpenRouterAIService;
        break;
}
```

#### Database Setup

#### MongoDB Configuration
1. Ensure MongoDB instance is running (v4.4+ recommended)
2. Create required collections:
   - `avatars`: Stores avatar data and metadata
   - `dungeon_stats`: Combat and stat tracking
   - `dungeon_log`: History of interactions and battles
   - `narratives`: Generated story elements
   - `memories`: Long-term memory storage
   - `messages`: Communication history
   - `locations`: Environmental data
   - `items`: In-world items and artifacts

#### Indexing
Create the following indexes for optimal performance:
```js
db.avatars.createIndex({ "avatarId": 1 }, { unique: true })
db.memories.createIndex({ "avatarId": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.messages.createIndex({ "channelId": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.messages.createIndex({ "messageId": 1 }, { unique: true })
```

#### Server Configuration

#### System Requirements
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ SSD storage
- 100Mbps+ network connection

#### Node.js Setup
- Use Node.js v18+ LTS
- Set appropriate memory limits:
  ```bash
  NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
  ```

#### Web Server
For production deployment, use Nginx as a reverse proxy:

1. Install Nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`
2. Configure Nginx using the template in `/config/nginx.conf`
3. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /path/to/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/moonstone
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

#### Service Management

#### Systemd Configuration
Create a systemd service for reliable operation:

1. Copy the service file: `sudo cp /config/moonstone-sanctum.service /etc/systemd/system/`
2. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable moonstone-sanctum
   sudo systemctl start moonstone-sanctum
   ```

3. Check status: `sudo systemctl status moonstone-sanctum`

#### API Rate Limits

#### External Service Limits
- **OpenRouter**: Based on your subscription plan (typically 3-10 req/min)
- **Google AI**: Based on your subscription plan
- **Discord API**: Stay within Discord's published rate limits
- **Replicate API**: Check your subscription quota
- **S3 Storage**: No practical limit for normal operation

#### Internal Rate Limiting
The system implements the following rate limits:
- AI Model calls: Max 5 per avatar per minute
- Image Generation: Max 2 per avatar per hour
- Avatar Creation: Max 3 per user per day

#### Monitoring and Logging

#### Log Files
All logs are in the `/logs` directory with the following structure:
- `application.log`: Main application logs
- `avatarService.log`: Avatar-related operations
- `discordService.log`: Discord interactions
- `aiService.log`: AI model interactions
- `errors.log`: Critical errors only

#### Log Rotation
Logs are automatically rotated:
- Daily rotation
- 7-day retention
- Compressed archives

#### Health Checks
The system exposes health endpoints:
- `/health`: Basic system health
- `/health/ai`: AI services status
- `/health/db`: Database connectivity

#### Backup Strategy

1. Database Backups:
   ```bash
   mongodump --uri="$MONGO_URI" --db="$MONGO_DB_NAME" --out=/backup/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   ```

2. Environment Backup:
   ```bash
   cp .env /backup/env/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).env
   ```

3. Automated Schedule:
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab
   0 1 * * * /path/to/scripts/backup.sh
   ```

#### Scaling Considerations

For high-traffic deployments:
- Implement MongoDB replication
- Set up multiple application instances behind a load balancer
- Use Redis for centralized caching
- Consider containerization with Docker/Kubernetes for easier scaling
